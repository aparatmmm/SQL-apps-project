# SQL-apps-project
SQL project of a database for an applications creator company.
Firstly, we create tables (customers, category, product_information, order_items, orders and promotions) using the tables file.
Then, we insert data from csv files named respectively as the tables.
For analysis we use the analysis.sql file. The process of it is described in the comments.
In a nutshell, we are able to distinguish different types of apps, analyse customers' emails, incomes and orders.
We can see promotions' influence on the company's profit and a surplus connected to warranty period.
